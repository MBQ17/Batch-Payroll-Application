The Batch Payroll Application use case diagram shows how different types of employees and external actors interact with the payroll system. Hourly and commission employees submit their timecards and sales receipts, while salaried employees receive paychecks. The Run Payroll Process use case includes calculating pay, updating employee records, generating paychecks, and deducting union dues and charges. After processing, the system distributes paychecks through various extended options such as mail, direct deposit, or pickup. External actors like the Bank, Postal Service, Paymaster, and Union assist in completing the payroll operations efficiently and accurately.
